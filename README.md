# Tweeter Project

A simple single-page AJAX-based titter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5, plain ol'CSS3 and SASS to help web bootcamp stuednts get comfortable with their front-end chops with these technologies.

## Some Things About Tweeter
We have a user-friendly interface that will only show the tweet textbox when you want to make a new tweet! You only have to click the button saying "write a new tweet" and it will show up! ðŸ¤—

Once you submit a tweet, it will show up as your latest tweet below the textbox! ðŸ¥³

Have you ever felt too lazy to scroll all the way up after you scroll down to read the old tweets? ðŸ˜« Don't worry! We have a magic scroll button that appears once you scroll down the page and will take you back to the top at once!ðŸ˜Ž
